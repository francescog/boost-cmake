Ryppl |release|
===============

.. rubric:: FIXME These docs still talk about boost.cmake

Ryppl is an effort to build standardthe ryppl distribution that all
the cool kids are using.  The effort started in earnest at `RypplCon
'07 <http://www.rypplcon.com>`_; by the end of which it was possible
to do a basic build of ryppl with cmake.  In 2009, the project moved
out to git version control.  Today, ``Ryppl.CMake`` is stable, mature,
and supported by the developers, a large base of expert users, and
occasionally by the authors of CMake itself.

About this documentation
========================

This documentation was created with `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_.  

The source is in the restructuredtext files in subdirectory
``tools/build/CMake/docs/source/``.  Hack on them (see the
`documentation for Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_).
When you're ready to see the html::

  make html

Once you've written a ton of docs, push them someplace where I can see
them (or use ``git diff`` to send a patch).

Why "alt.ryppl"?
----------------

The 'alt' is a reference to the ``alt.*`` Usenet hierarchy.  Here, as
in Usenet, *alt* stands for `Anarchists, Lunatics and Terrorists
<http://nylon.net/alt/index.htm>`_.  This independent effort explores
and applies alternate techniques/technologies in the areas of build,
version control, testing, packaging, documentation and release
management.
